# ConsoleUtils

This is a simple little command line utility library I use in some of my Elixir projects.

It's not really finished, TODOs are left here and there, but I'll update it as I need new functions from that lib.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:consoleUtils, github: "simonced/elixir-consoleutils", app: false}]
end
```

## DOC

TODO once I validated the dependency is working.
